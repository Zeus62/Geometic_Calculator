# Geometric Calculator

## Overview

The Geometric Calculator is a Java application that calculates the area and perimeter of various geometric shapes, including circles, rectangles, and squares. It utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Features

- **Shape Selection:** Users can choose from three geometric shapes: Circle, Rectangle, and Square.
- **Dynamic Input Fields:** Based on the selected shape, the application dynamically adjusts the input fields to collect necessary dimensions.
- **Calculation and Display:** The application calculates the area and perimeter based on user input and displays the results.

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- Swing (for GUI)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

## Structure

The project is structured into multiple classes:

- **`MyProject`:** The main class that launches the application.
- **`GeometricObject`:** An abstract class representing the common interface for all geometric shapes.
- **`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`:** Concrete classes extending `GeometricObject` to implement specific area and perimeter calculations.
- **`Framee`:** The GUI class that handles user interactions and displays the results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zeus62/Geometic_Calculator.git
